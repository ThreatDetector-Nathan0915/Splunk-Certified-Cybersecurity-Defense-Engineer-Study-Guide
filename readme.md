### 2.1 Splunk Fundamentals

---

#### **Splunk Architecture and Components**

Understanding the key components of Splunk architecture is crucial for effectively using Splunk for security purposes. The architecture consists of the following elements:

- **Search Heads**: Responsible for performing searches across indexed data. 
  - Example: When you run a query, the Search Head distributes the search across multiple Indexers and aggregates the results.
  
- **Indexers**: Store and index data coming from different sources. Indexers also process incoming data and make it searchable.
  - Example: When logs are ingested from firewalls, they are parsed and stored by the Indexers.

- **Forwarders**: Forwarders collect and send data to Splunk Indexers. There are two types: **Universal Forwarder** (lightweight) and **Heavy Forwarder** (can parse data).
  - Example: Use a Universal Forwarder to collect logs from multiple servers and send them to the central Indexer.

- **Deployment Servers**: Deployment Servers manage configurations and distribute apps to all forwarders in your deployment.
  - Example: A Deployment Server can push a new configuration to all forwarders for logging Windows events.

**Data Flow in Splunk**:
- Data flows through **forwarders** to the **indexers**, which then process, store, and make the data searchable via **search heads**.

---

#### **Data Inputs**

Splunk can ingest data from various sources, and understanding how to configure data inputs is essential:

- **Syslog Input**: One of the most common methods for sending logs from network devices and servers.
  - Example: You can configure a syslog input to capture logs from a firewall by using the `UDP` protocol and listening on port 514.

- **HTTP Event Collector (HEC)**: A method for sending data to Splunk using HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Example: Sending data from cloud applications via HEC involves configuring an input on the HEC and using a POST request to send data.

- **File Monitoring**: Splunk can monitor files or directories for changes and index the data.
  - Example: Monitor `/var/log/auth.log` on a Linux system to capture login activity.

**Index Time vs Search Time Operations**:
- **Index Time**: When data is ingested, fields are extracted at index time, which allows for more efficient searching later.
  - Example: Source type, host, and other metadata are extracted during data ingestion.
  
- **Search Time**: Some fields (like complex key-value pairs or dynamic fields) can be extracted at search time, which allows for more flexible searching.
  - Example: Extracting HTTP response codes from logs dynamically during search.

---

#### **Search Processing Language (SPL) Basics**

SPL is the core language used to query and analyze data within Splunk. Mastering these commands is crucial for both exam preparation and real-world Splunk usage.

##### Core SPL Commands

- **`stats`**: Performs statistical calculations on your data.
  - Example: Calculate the count of events by HTTP status code.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | stats count by status
    ```

- **`eval`**: Used to create new fields or manipulate existing fields.
  - Example: Create a new field based on conditional logic.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | eval status_type = if(status >= 400, "Error", "Success")
    ```

- **`table`**: Format the output as a table.
  - Example: Display the IP and status fields in a table format.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | table ip, status
    ```

- **`sort`**: Sort the results based on one or more fields.
  - Example: Sort results by timestamp in descending order.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | sort - _time
    ```

- **`timechart`**: Create a time-based chart to visualize data over time.
  - Example: Count HTTP requests over time.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | timechart count
    ```

##### Advanced SPL Commands

- **`join`**: Combine data from multiple indexes or data sources based on a common field.
  - Example: Join web logs and security logs by IP address.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | join ip [search index=security_logs]
    ```

- **`transaction`**: Group events into transactions based on some criteria.
  - Example: Group all actions taken by a single user session.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | transaction session_id
    ```

- **`append`**: Append results of a subsearch to the current search results.
  - Example: Append results from two different searches.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs | append [search index=security_logs]
    ```

---

#### **Writing and Optimizing SPL Queries for Performance**

Efficient query writing ensures that searches complete faster, especially in large-scale deployments.

1. **Use Index Early**: Always specify the index as early as possible in your searches to reduce the amount of data to scan.
   - Example: Start with `index=web_logs` instead of just searching globally.

2. **Limit Time Range**: Restrict searches to specific time periods.
   - Example: Use `earliest` and `latest` time modifiers.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs earliest=-1d latest=now
    ```

3. **Selective Field Search**: Use specific fields in the search to reduce the search scope.
   - Example: Instead of searching all fields, focus on required ones like `status`.
    ```spl
    index=web_logs status=404
    ```

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Commands**: Don't use commands like `join` unless absolutely necessary, as they can slow down performance.
   - Instead of using `join`, try restructuring your data model or use `lookup` or `stats` to achieve similar outcomes.

5. **Parallel Processing**: Use `map` to parallelize searches when necessary, but use it sparingly as it increases load.

   Example of using **`map`**:
   ```spl
   index=web_logs | map search="search index=security_logs ip=$ip$"
   ```

   ### 2.2 Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)

---

#### **Overview of Splunk ES**

Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is a premium app that sits on top of Splunk and is tailored for security use cases. It provides a security-specific interface, along with prebuilt dashboards and workflows to help detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

##### Key Components of Splunk ES:
- **Incident Review Dashboard**: The main dashboard where notable events are reviewed and analyzed.
  - Example: Security analysts can review events categorized as notable based on predefined or custom security rules.

- **Security Domains**: Splunk ES organizes its content into domains, such as:
  - **Access**: Tracks user access attempts and logs for potential unauthorized access.
  - **Endpoint**: Focuses on monitoring endpoints for suspicious activity.
  - **Network**: Monitors network traffic for anomalies and intrusions.
  - **Identity**: Integrates identity-based information, like user accounts and privileges.
  - **Threat**: Detects known and emerging threats using threat intelligence feeds.

##### Security Domains: Asset and Identity Framework, Risk-Based Alerting (RBA)

- **Asset and Identity Framework**: Allows organizations to map data from hosts and users to assets and identities, which adds context to events.
  - Example: When a security alert is triggered, ES can correlate the event with asset information (e.g., criticality) and identity (e.g., user roles) to prioritize responses.

- **Risk-Based Alerting (RBA)**: Instead of alerting on individual events, ES uses risk scores to identify threats by aggregating multiple alerts or behaviors.
  - Example: A user logging in from two different countries within a short timeframe might increase their risk score, triggering a notable event for investigation.

##### Use Cases:
- **Threat Detection**: Identify and monitor for malware infections, unauthorized access, and suspicious activity using prebuilt and custom correlation searches.
  - Example: A malware infection can be detected by analyzing endpoint logs and flagging specific processes or IP addresses.

- **Vulnerability Management**: Integrate vulnerability scanners (e.g., Qualys, Tenable) to track and prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk.
  - Example: A report could show all critical vulnerabilities detected on high-priority assets to focus remediation efforts.

- **Incident Response**: Utilize the Incident Review dashboard to track incidents, assign ownership, and escalate based on priority.
  - Example: When a notable event is triggered, an analyst can investigate the alert, assign it for further investigation, and escalate to incident responders if necessary.

---

#### **Correlation Searches**

Correlation searches are the backbone of Splunk ES’s threat detection capability. They are pre-built or custom searches that automatically analyze incoming data for known patterns of security incidents.

##### Configuring and Tuning Correlation Searches

- **Built-in Correlation Searches**: Splunk ES comes with many predefined searches for common security use cases (e.g., brute-force attacks, malware detection).
  - Example: A correlation search may detect brute force login attempts by looking for multiple failed login attempts within a short timeframe.
    ```spl
    `failed_logins` | stats count by user, src_ip | where count > 5
    ```

- **Tuning Correlation Searches**: To avoid alert fatigue, it's important to adjust correlation searches to your environment.
  - Example: Adjust the threshold in a failed login correlation search to suit your environment (e.g., raising the threshold to 10 failed attempts instead of 5 for environments with frequent login errors).
    ```spl
    `failed_logins` | stats count by user, src_ip | where count > 10
    ```

- **Custom Correlation Searches**: You can create custom searches to monitor specific activities or behaviors.
  - Example: Create a custom correlation search to detect privilege escalation attempts by tracking changes in user roles.
    ```spl
    index=security_logs action="role_change" | stats count by user, new_role | where count > 1
    ```

##### Best Practices for Correlation Searches:
1. **Use Risk Scores**: Assign risk scores to events instead of triggering alerts for every correlation match to prioritize high-risk incidents.
2. **Optimize for Performance**: Keep searches efficient by specifying indexes and limiting the time range of searches.
3. **Tune for Specific Environments**: Adjust thresholds and conditions based on normal behavior in your organization to reduce false positives.

---

#### **Notable Events and Incident Review**

Notable events are the central mechanism for investigating incidents in Splunk ES. These are security events flagged by correlation searches, and they provide a structured workflow for incident management.

##### Managing and Investigating Notable Events

- **Notable Events**: These are security-relevant events that are surfaced based on correlation searches. Each notable event contains information such as time, affected assets, risk score, and associated logs.
  - Example: A notable event might be triggered when multiple failed login attempts are followed by a successful login from the same user.

- **Investigation Steps**: Analysts can review notable events in the Incident Review dashboard, where they can:
  - View details of the event and relevant fields (e.g., source IP, username).
  - Drill down into associated logs to analyze the root cause.
  - Add comments, assign ownership, and escalate incidents based on severity.
    - Example: An event involving unauthorized access might be escalated to a different team for further investigation.

##### Workflows for Incident Analysis and Escalation

- **Incident Review Dashboard**: This dashboard is used to manage the entire lifecycle of a security incident, from detection to resolution.
  - **Status and Urgency**: Each event can be assigned a status (e.g., `New`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`) and urgency (e.g., `High`, `Low`) to prioritize incidents.
  - **Ownership and Escalation**: Incidents can be assigned to individual analysts or teams for investigation. If an incident is determined to be high risk, it can be escalated to a higher tier for further action.

##### Best Practices for Incident Review:
1. **Use Status and Urgency Fields**: Prioritize incidents based on their impact on business-critical assets and services.
2. **Leverage Asset and Identity Context**: Use the Asset and Identity Framework to add context to notable events, making investigations more efficient.
3. **Integrate with SOAR**: Consider integrating Splunk ES with Splunk SOAR for automated responses to high-severity incidents (e.g., automatically isolating a compromised host).

##### Example Workflow:
1. A notable event is triggered due to a suspicious login attempt.
2. The incident is assigned to a security analyst for review.
3. The analyst investigates the associated logs, identifies a successful login from an unusual location, and escalates the incident.
4. The incident is resolved after the user confirms the login was legitimate, or remediation actions are taken (e.g., disabling the user account).

By understanding these core components and workflows, you'll be able to effectively detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents using Splunk ES.

### 2.3 Security Monitoring and Incident Response

---

#### **Security Use Cases**

Security use cases in Splunk ES revolve around detecting, investigating, and responding to potential threats and suspicious activities. Some key use cases include:

##### Detecting Anomalies, Malicious Insider Activities, Phishing, and Malware

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual behavior that deviates from normal patterns, such as an unexpected increase in network traffic from a specific host.
  - Example SPL query to detect anomalies in network traffic:
    ```spl
    index=network_logs | stats avg(bytes_in) as avg_bytes by src_ip 
    | where avg_bytes > 100000  # Adjust threshold based on normal behavior
    ```

- **Malicious Insider Activities**: Monitoring for unusual user activities, such as access to sensitive files at odd times or multiple failed login attempts.
  - Example SPL query to detect multiple failed login attempts:
    ```spl
    index=auth_logs action="failure" | stats count by user 
    | where count > 5
    ```

- **Phishing Detection**: Identifying phishing attempts through email headers, URLs, or file attachments that match known patterns of malicious content.
  - Example SPL query to identify emails with suspicious URLs:
    ```spl
    index=email_logs | search subject="*urgent*" OR subject="*password*" 
    | regex url="http(s)?://(.*)\.xyz"
    ```

- **Malware Detection**: Monitoring for signs of malware infection, such as unusual processes, file changes, or communications with known malicious domains.
  - Example SPL query to detect communication with known malware-related IPs:
    ```spl
    index=network_logs | join src_ip [| inputlookup malware_ips.csv] 
    | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip
    ```

##### Monitoring and Alerting for Unauthorized Access Attempts

Splunk can help monitor for unauthorized access attempts by setting up real-time alerts for suspicious behavior like failed login attempts, privilege escalations, or access from unusual locations.

- **Unauthorized Access Monitoring**: Detecting access attempts from blacklisted IPs or countries not typically associated with normal operations.
  - Example SPL query to alert on access from suspicious geolocations:
    ```spl
    index=auth_logs | lookup geoip ip as src_ip 
    | search country!="US"  # Replace with your primary country
    ```

- **Privilege Escalation Detection**: Monitoring for sudden changes in user privileges, especially if they occur outside of normal administrative procedures.
  - Example SPL query to detect privilege escalation:
    ```spl
    index=security_logs action="role_change" | stats count by user, new_role 
    | where new_role="admin"
    ```

---

#### **Incident Response Playbooks**

Incident response playbooks in Splunk automate the response to common security incidents. These playbooks define workflows that trigger specific actions when certain conditions are met, allowing faster and more consistent handling of security events.

##### Automation of Incident Response Using Splunk SOAR

Splunk SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) allows security teams to automate responses to incidents, minimizing manual effort and reducing response times.

- **Phishing Incident Playbook**: Automatically detects phishing emails, quarantines them, and notifies users.
  - Example Playbook Actions:
    1. Detect a suspicious email with a phishing pattern (using an email subject or suspicious URL).
    2. Extract sender information and quarantine the email.
    3. Block the sender's IP and domain.
    4. Notify the user and security team.

- **Brute Force Attack Playbook**: Detects brute-force login attempts, blocks the offending IP, and notifies the incident response team.
  - Example Playbook Actions:
    1. Monitor for multiple failed login attempts.
    2. Block the offending IP via firewall integration.
    3. Notify the SOC for further investigation.

##### Writing Playbooks for Common Security Incidents

To write playbooks in Splunk SOAR, you'll typically define the triggers (such as an alert or notable event), followed by the series of automated actions (response steps).

Example JSON definition for a brute force attack playbook:
```json
{
  "playbook_name": "Brute Force Attack Response",
  "trigger": {
    "event": "MultipleFailedLogins"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "block_ip",
      "parameters": {
        "ip": "$src_ip"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "notify_team",
      "parameters": {
        "team": "SOC",
        "message": "Brute force attack detected and mitigated"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Dashboarding and Reporting
Splunk provides powerful visualization and reporting capabilities, which allow security teams to monitor the environment in real-time and produce reports for management and compliance purposes.

Creating Security Operations Dashboards
Dashboards provide a real-time view into security operations, showing critical metrics like the number of incidents, types of threats, and active investigations.

Security Operations Center (SOC) Dashboard: Displays key metrics like notable events, open incidents, and threat levels across the organization.

Example of a simple SPL query for a SOC dashboard:
index=security_logs | stats count by threat_level

Custom MITRE ATT&CK Dashboard: Map observed techniques and tactics in your environment to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Example SPL query to detect TTPs related to a specific MITRE technique (e.g., T1078 - Valid Accounts):
index=auth_logs | search action="login" user!="admin" | stats count by src_ip, user

Generating and Sharing Security Reports
Splunk makes it easy to generate security reports that can be used for auditing, compliance, or executive communication. Reports can be scheduled and automatically sent to stakeholders.

Compliance Report: Generate regular reports on log retention, system access, and incident response metrics.

Example SPL query for a report on access log activity:
index=auth_logs | stats count by user, action, _time

Incident Summary Report: A summary report that shows incident response times, incident categories, and resolutions for management oversight.

Example SPL query to create an incident summary:
index=incident_review | stats count by incident_status, incident_category

Using Pre-Built Dashboards for Security Use Cases (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK)
Splunk ES includes several pre-built dashboards designed for specific security use cases, such as mapping security events to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of current threats and ongoing incidents.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework Dashboard: Pre-built dashboard to track and map detected techniques and tactics to the MITRE framework.
You can customize this dashboard by adding your own searches and correlating data from internal logs with ATT&CK techniques.

This section provides a comprehensive explanation of **Security Monitoring and Incident Response** in Splunk, complete with practical use cases, queries, playbooks, and reporting techniques. This information is designed to help you understand key topics required for both practical Splunk usage and certification exams.

### 2.4 Threat Intelligence and Automation

---

#### **Integration of Threat Feeds**

Threat feeds provide information about known malicious entities such as IP addresses, domains, file hashes, and other Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). Integrating these feeds with Splunk enables organizations to correlate external intelligence with internal data to detect potential threats.

##### Integrating Third-Party Threat Intelligence Sources with Splunk

Splunk can integrate with various third-party threat intelligence sources, such as VirusTotal, AlienVault, and IBM X-Force. These feeds are ingested and used for correlation to detect matches between internal network activity and known threats.

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
  - External threat feeds can be ingested as CSV, STIX, TAXII, or via API connections.
  
  Example of integrating CSV-based threat feed:
  ```bash
  ./splunk add oneshot /path/to/threat_feed.csv -index threat_intel
  ```
Using Scheduled Inputs for Continuous Updates: You can automate the pulling of threat data at regular intervals using inputs.conf.

Example of scheduling a daily threat feed input:
[script://./bin/get-threat-feed.sh]
interval = 86400  # Run every 24 hours
index = threat_intel
sourcetype = csv

Using Threat Intelligence Framework in Splunk ES
Splunk ES includes a Threat Intelligence Framework that simplifies the process of managing, normalizing, and correlating threat intelligence with your organization's security data.

Threat Intelligence Manager: Central interface in Splunk ES to manage threat feeds and cross-correlate them with internal logs.

Example: A malicious IP address from a feed can be automatically compared with internal network logs to flag suspicious activity.
Example SPL for correlating threat intelligence data with internal logs:
index=network_logs [| inputlookup threatintel_by_ip] | stats count by src_ip

Risk-Based Scoring Using Threat Intelligence: Assign risk scores to assets or users based on threat intelligence, helping prioritize incidents with higher potential impact.

Example: If a critical server communicates with a known malicious IP, its risk score is automatically elevated, triggering an alert.

Automated Threat Detection
Automation in threat detection helps organizations identify emerging threats and respond more efficiently. Splunk’s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) allows you to apply machine learning algorithms for proactive detection of anomalies and suspicious behavior.

Leveraging Machine Learning for Threat Detection
Splunk’s MLTK provides a set of tools for applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to detect unusual or malicious activity.

Unsupervised Learning: This method can be used to group similar events or detect outliers (anomalies). One common use case is anomaly detection in network traffic.

Example of using k-means clustering to group similar traffic patterns:
| inputlookup network_logs.csv | kmeans k=5 action_field="group"

Supervised Learning: You can train models on historical data to predict or classify future events (e.g., detecting malware based on past behaviors).

Example of training a logistic regression model for threat detection:
| inputlookup training_data.csv
| fit LogisticRegression "threat" from "src_ip", "bytes_in", "bytes_out"

Anomaly Detection Techniques Using Splunk's MLTK
Anomaly detection techniques are used to flag unusual activities that deviate from established baselines. This is useful for detecting insider threats or advanced persistent threats (APTs).

Time Series Anomaly Detection: Identify deviations from normal behavior over time.

Example SPL for time series-based anomaly detection:
index=network_logs | timechart avg(bytes_out) by src_ip | anomalydetection action="filter"

Adaptive Thresholding: Instead of static thresholds, adaptive thresholding uses historical patterns to adjust thresholds dynamically, improving accuracy in threat detection.

Example: Detecting excessive login attempts by dynamically adjusting the threshold based on user activity history.

SOAR Use Cases
Splunk SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) allows security teams to automate responses to incidents, reducing response time and ensuring consistent handling of threats. By integrating SOAR with Splunk, you can automate workflows (called playbooks) for common security use cases like phishing attacks and brute-force login attempts.

Automating Responses to Common Threats (Phishing, Brute Force Attacks)
Phishing Response Playbook: SOAR can automatically detect phishing emails, quarantine them, and notify affected users and security personnel.

Example Phishing Response Playbook Actions:

1. Detect phishing email based on subject, content, or sender.
2. Quarantine the email.
3. Block the sender’s domain or IP.
4. Notify the security team and user.

Example SPL query to detect potential phishing emails:
index=email_logs | search subject="*urgent*" OR url="*suspicious_domain*"

Brute Force Attack Response Playbook: SOAR can detect brute-force attacks, automatically block the offending IP, and notify the SOC.

Example Brute Force Response Playbook Actions:
1.Detect multiple failed login attempts within a short time window.
2. Block the IP via firewall integration.
3. Notify the security operations center (SOC) for further review.

Example SPL query to detect brute-force login attempts:
index=auth_logs action="failure" | stats count by src_ip 
| where count > 10

Integration of SOAR with Other Security Tools (Firewalls, IDS/IPS, etc.)
SOAR can integrate with various security tools to automate responses, such as blocking malicious IPs on a firewall, disabling user accounts in Active Directory, or isolating infected machines via endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

Firewall Integration: Automatically block IPs identified as malicious by threat intelligence or anomaly detection.

Example Playbook Action to Block IP:
{
  "action": "block_ip",
  "parameters": {
    "ip": "$src_ip"
  }
}
IDS/IPS Integration: Automatically trigger rules on your intrusion detection/prevention systems based on alerts from Splunk.

Example: Create a Splunk alert to trigger a custom rule in Snort or Suricata when suspicious traffic is detected.

By automating these workflows, SOAR significantly reduces the time and effort required to mitigate common security threats, ensuring a faster and more consistent response.
